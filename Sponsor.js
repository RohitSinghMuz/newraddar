      <h5>SPONSOR AN API OF ICE AND FIRE Background</h5>
      <p>
        I've actively developed and maintained this project for years and it has
        been a great success! Sadly though it's not free to host an API of this
        magnitude. That's why I'm looking for people or companies that are
        willing to sponsor the site, look down below for more information.
      </p>
      <h5>What do I get as a sponsor?</h5>
      <p>
        You will get a banner at the top of every page with a text of your
        choosing that will be displayed for 1 month Your message will be shown
        to thousands of people and the amount of requests that this API serves
        is over 1 million per month!
      </p>
      <h5>How to sponsor</h5>
      <p>Send me an email and we'll discuss the details</p>
